# SYNTHESIS://STRDT *-formerly The Ashen Sleep*
*A 2D Action-Roguelite inspired by Death Stranding, Shadow of Mordor, and Hollow Knight.*

## About the Game  
**SYNTHESIS://STRDT** drops players into a fractured world following the **Veil Cataclysm**, where life has retreated underground and the sky above bleeds memory. You awaken in a dormant **VEIL Bunker**, unsure of who you areâ€”haunted by flickers of a past life.

The surface is shattered into strange biomes, echoing with corruption, warped creatures, and unstable phenomena. Underground AIs maintain a fragile hold on the last surviving bunkers. As you explore, fight, and adapt, youâ€™ll uncover memory fragments, dormant terminals, and a buried purpose far larger than yourself.

## Core Features  
- **Roguelite Systems**: Dying reshapes your pathâ€”some memory fragments persist, others must be earned again.
- **Biome & Bunker Exploration**: Navigate corrupted surface ruins and ancient underground AI networks.
- **Environmental Lore Discovery**: Story is told through **Echoes**, **Divine Fragments**, **Shrine Logs**, and **AI Terminals**â€”not exposition dumps.
- **Ethical Systems & Choices**: Absorbing certain enemies alters your path. Mercy matters.  
- **Facility Reconnection System**: Restore critical power to disconnected VEIL systems and unlock new pathways and secrets.
- **Surface Survival**: Collapse on the surface and your robotic assistant **N0-DL3 ("Noodle")** will rescue youâ€”at a cost.

| **Persistent Upgrades** | Some abilities stay with you across deaths. Others return only when rediscovered. |
| **Moral Branching** | Some choices subtly affect how AI, anomalies, and even bunkers respond to you. |

## Contribution  
This is a solo/student-led prototype, but feedback and collaboration are welcome.

## Spoiler Warning  
The gameâ€™s story is built on **fragmented memory, player-driven discovery, and narrative ambiguity**.  
Who you are, what happened, and what still *lives* aboveâ€”none of that is handed to you. Every answer you earn is a piece of a much bigger puzzle.

## ðŸ§ª Codename Note  
The in-universe name for the gameâ€™s underlying science is tied to the **STRDT** matterâ€”an unstable atmospheric compound recovered post-cataclysm.  
Your role in **Project 1N34** remains classified.
