## About The Game
The Ashen Sleep plunges players into a haunting post-cataclysmic Earth where humanity has fractured, and survival depends on uncovering hidden truths. Awakened from a long slumber inside a forgotten facility, you explore a corrupted surface world filled with twisted creatures and ancient underground sanctuaries kept alive by sentient AI.
As you journey through interconnected biomes and forsaken facilities, you battle relentless foes, uncover fragments of memory, and piece together a cosmic mystery that challenges your very identity.
Core themes include:
- Cosmic horror and loss
- Identity, memory, and creation
- The delicate balance between technology and nature

## Important Note on Story & Spoilers
The player’s true origins and the nature of their memories are central mysteries of the game. To preserve the experience, these details are intentionally hidden during early gameplay and revealed gradually through story progression. Players start with memories that may not be their own, and discovering the truth is part of the journey.
