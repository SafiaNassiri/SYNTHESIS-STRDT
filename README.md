*A 2D Action-Roguelite Metroidvania inspired by Death Stranding, Shadow of Mordor, and Hollow Knight.*

## About The Game
**The Ashen Sleep** immerses players in a bleak, post-cataclysmic Earth. You awaken from stasis in a decaying underground facility—no memory, no mission. The surface above is a scarred, toxic wasteland where corrupted creatures roam and long-dormant machines stir. Sentient AI still operate beneath, clinging to their original directives in a world that’s moved on—or died trying.

Players traverse vast, interconnected biomes—both ruined surface cities and hidden subterranean complexes—battling grotesque enemies, recovering memory fragments, and reconnecting isolated facilities. Each step brings you closer to a revelation that challenges the very foundation of your identity and what it means to be “human.”

### Themes
- Cosmic horror and the unknown
- Memory, identity, and rebirth
- Isolation, entropy, and technological decay
- Resistance against artificial gods

## ⚠️ Spoiler Warning
The Ashen Sleep is designed around mystery, misdirection, and self-discovery. Key elements of your identity, your purpose, and the nature of the world are obscured at the start. Memory Fragments—earned in gameplay—reveal narrative layers at your own pace. Player choices influence how much truth is uncovered, and which truths stay buried.
